--- INTRO ---

LogWatch is a customizable log analysis system. LogWatch parses
through your system's logs for a given period of time and creates a
report analyzing areas that you specify, in as much detail as you
require.

The collected results are reported to a chosen e-mail address,
root by default.

LogWatch 2.1.1 is a part of the Red Hat Linux 7.2 distribution,
enabled by default and daily run by the cron daemon.

--- PROBLEM ---

On a system running LogWatch, a local user is able to gain
unauthorized root access, due to a race condition during
the temporary directory creation.
